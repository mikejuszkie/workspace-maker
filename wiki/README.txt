The Workspace-Maker is designed to set up a complete workspace and Git 
repo. This getts the directory and links set up all by running a script. 
Future improvements include but not limited to, are: Template setups, 
MakeFile options, and a more flushed out set of directory options. 
Possibly add a menu style interface.
